### Translate from Korean.workflow

It's a OS X service that opens the currently selected text in a web browser
in [Naver Translate](http://translate.naver.com). I was using this a lot, and
wanted a way to look up up text in it very quickly.

Naver Translate generates sentence-to-sentence, or fragment-to-fragment
translations, that are usually more accurate than Google. Underneath the
translation, it also breaks down the sentence, showing the meaning of
individual words and phrases.

Compare: [Naver][naver-translate-example] with
[Google][google-translate-example].


### Installation instructions

Download the [latest release][latest-release], unzip and install the service by
double clicking it. Follow [this guide][services-how-to] if you want to bind
